♻️ Refactor PageLayout: Extract hooks and components for better organization

Reduced PageLayout.tsx from 686 to 429 lines (37.5% smaller) by extracting
logic into dedicated hooks, utilities, and sub-components.

New Utilities (lib/utils/):
- startupConfig.ts: Centralized startup sequence configuration
- contentOpacityUtils.ts: Pure functions for content opacity calculations

New Hooks (hooks/):
- useStartupSequence: Manages startup animation orchestration
- useStarSpeedAnimation: Handles smooth star speed transitions
- useLanguageTransition: Tracks language change transitions
- Enhanced useContentState: Added fromContentState/toContentState tracking

New Components (components/ui/):
- ControlsCorner: Composes Language Selector + CV Button + Speed Selector
- ContentSection: Handles conditional rendering of hero/projects/contact

Benefits:
- Better separation of concerns (layout vs logic vs animation)
- Improved testability (hooks and utilities can be tested in isolation)
- Enhanced maintainability (single responsibility per file)
- PageLayout is now truly about layout composition
